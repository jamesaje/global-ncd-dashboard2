# Global Non-Communicable Diseases Mortality Insights

A Power BI dashboard analyzing premature NCD mortality (% of total NCD deaths) by income group, region, and gender — designed for public health insights.


## Project Overview

This project explores the burden of **non-communicable diseases (NCDs)** using official data from the **World Health Organization (WHO)**. The dashboard focuses on **premature deaths (before age 70)** due to NCDs, providing global insights across:

- World Bank income groups
- WHO-defined regions
- Gender (male vs female)



## Key Metrics

- **Premature NCD Deaths (Global Average)**
- **Premature NCD Deaths – High-Income Countries**
- **Premature NCD Deaths – Low-Income Countries**
- **Probability of Dying from NCDs (Ages 30–70)**
- **Gender Gap in Probability of Dying**
